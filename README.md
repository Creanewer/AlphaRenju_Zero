# AlphaZero-version AI Program in the Game of Renju(Gomoku)

Introduction
====
Google DeepMinds recent AlphaZero algorithm, accepting no domain-specific knowledges, mastered the game of Go, chess and shogi through self-played reinforcement learning from scratch, showing the potential of general AI, which is the holy grail of the entire AI community. In this project, we implement an AlphaZero-version Renju(Gomoku) AI program and provide a step-by-step tutorial on the technique.

To do:
====
- Network parameters will be shared once we finish training.
- Currently, we are working on a step-by-step tutorial on AlphaZero algorithm and it will be released soon.
